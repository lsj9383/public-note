   Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland

<div class="chapter"> 
  <p class="square">Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are 
    Squares (to which class I myself belong) and Five-Sided  
    Figures or <a  
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon">Pentagons 
    </a>. 
  </p> 
  <p class="nobility hexagon">Next above these come the  
    Nobility, of whom there are several degrees, beginning at  
    Six-Sided Figures, or <a  
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">Hexagons</a>,  
    and from thence rising in the number of their sides till  
    they receive the honourable title of <a  
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon">Polygonal</a>,  
    or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides  
    becomes so numerous, and the sides themselves so small,  
    that the figure cannot be distinguished from a <a  
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circle</a>, he  
    is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is  
    the highest class of all. 
  </p> 
  <p><span class="pull-quote">It is a <span class="drop">Law  
    of Nature</span> with us that a male child shall have  
    <strong>one more side</strong> than his father</span>, so  
    that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in  
    the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a  
    Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon;  
    and so on.
